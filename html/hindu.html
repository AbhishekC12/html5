        <h3>SC stays arrest
            of lawyer on
            fact-fnding
            mission </h3>
        </div>
        <div>
            The Supreme Court on
            Tuesday stayed the arrest of
            a woman lawyer who took
            part in a fact-fnding mission to violence-hit Manipur
            and subsequently held a
            press meet for the National
            Federation of Indian Women (NFIW).
            Appearing before a
            Bench led by Chief Justice
            D.Y. Chandrachud in an urgent mentioning, senior advocate Siddharth Dave said
            the lawyer, Deeksha Dwivedi, has been accused of sedition and conspiracy to wage
            war against India, among
            other ofences. He informed
            the court that his client had
            not yet received a copy of
            the FIR. “The Solicitor General may take instructions
            on the background of the
            case. List on Friday. Till 5
            p.m. on Friday, no coercive
            steps will be taken against
            the petitioner,” the court recorded in its interim order.

            <h2>6 Opposition members on House panel
                raised alarm over Forest Bill exemptions
                </h2>
            The Supreme Court
on Tuesday asked
Enforcement Directorate (ED) Director
Sanjay Kumar Mishra to
quit four months before his
third extension ends in November even as it upheld
statutory amendments
that facilitate the tenures of
Directors of the Central Bureau of Investigation and
the ED to be stretched
“piecemeal”.
CBI and ED chiefs have
fxed tenures of two years.
However, amendments introduced in 2021 to the
Central Vigilance Commission Act, the Delhi Special
Police Establishment Act
and the Fundamental
Rules allow them three annual extensions.
The tweaks in the law
came shortly after the Supreme Court, in a September 2021 judgment, directed the government to stop
giving extensions to Mr.
Mishra. The amendments
allowed the government to
overcome the court’s direction and grant Mr. Mishra another two
extensions.
A Bench headed by Justice B.R. Gavai on Tuesday
held that the back-to-back
service extensions given to
Mr. Mishra in 2021 and
2022 were both invalid and
illegal. The court, however,
gave Mr. Mishra time till July 31 to quit ofce. The
court said the leeway to aid
with the “smooth transition” of ofcial responsibilities to his successor. Mr.
Mishra is in his ffth year as
ED Director.
By upholding the 2021
amendments, the court
disagreed with the submissions made by its own amicus curiae, senior advocate
K.V. Viswanathan, now a
Supreme Court judge.
The amicus curiae had
urged the court to strike
down the amendments.
Mr. Viswanathan had argued that the Centre could
use the prospect of service
extensions as a “carrot and
stick” policy to ensure that
the CBI and ED Directors
work according to its wishes. He had contended that
a Director “would always
succumb to the pressure of
the government so as to ensure that he gets further extension”. The petitioners
too had submitted that the
amendments went against
the very principle of insulating the Central investigative agencies from government pressure.

            <h2> Tribe members should
                be part of supervisory
                teams: SC to Manipur</h2>
            The Supreme Court
on Tuesday asked
the Manipur government to ‘duly consider’ including members of
the Zo-Kuki tribes in the
teams of MLAs and Ministers formed by the State to
oversee the supervision
and management of relief
camps for victims of the
violence.
The fact that not a single
MLA from the Zo-Kuki
tribes was part of these
teams was brought to light
in court by advocate Nizam
Pasha, appearing for the
Zomi Students’ Federation, before a Bench headed by Chief Justice of India
D.Y. Chandrachud.
“There are seven teams
of Ministers and MLAs
formed by the State government, as per a July 5
order, to oversee work in
the relief camps in seven
districts. The State Assembly has 60 MLAs. Thirty-fve of these MLAs fnd
their place in these
teams… But not a single
one is from the Zo-Kuki
tribes,” Mr. Pasha
submitted.
The seven teams are
fanned out across Bishnupur, Churachandpur, Imphal West, Imphal West,
Kangpokpi, Kakching &
Thoubal and Tengnoupal.
The court recorded that
the State should “duly consider” the suggestion for
“suitable action”.
Orally, Chief Justice
Chandrachud said broadbased committees tend to
boost public confdence
more.
“Better to include
them,” Justice P.S. Narasimha told Mr. Mehta.
The court asked the
State government to take
“positive action” on other
suggestions made by Mr.
Pasha, including allowing
families with missing relatives access to mortuaries
with unclaimed bodies,
identifcation of the dead
and their handover for last
rites.
Other suggestions listed
for positive action include
sufcient number of doctors in district hospitals in
the hill districts, and essential medical care and
equipment.
Mr. Pasha drew the
court’s attention to the
shortage of drinking water,
food, sanitation, shelter
and bedding in relief
camps run by self-help
groups.
The court further asked
Mr. Mehta to consider having security adviser Kuldiep Singh chair the interagency unifed command
rather than the Chief
Minister.

            <h4>Centre told to clarify
                stand on Places of
                Worship Act by Oct. 31</h4>
            At least six out of the 31
members of the Joint Parliamentary Committee on
Forest (Conservation)
Amendment Bill have fled
dissent notes, raising an
alarm over exemptions extended to signifcant tracts
of land in the draft legislation, even as the panel
cleared the controversial
Bill without proposing any
changes.
The Bill is expected to
be tabled in Parliament in
the Monsoon Session that
starts on July 20.
The dissenting members are Congress MPs Pradyot Bordoloi (from the
Lok Sabha) and Phulo Devi
Netam (Rajya Sabha); Trinamool Congress MPs Jawahar Sircar (Rajya Sabha)
and Sajda Ahmed (Lok
Sabha); and DMK MPs T.R.
Baalu and R. Girirajan. The
Bill seeks to amend the Forest (Conservation) Act,
1980, that was brought in
to check uncontrolled and
unregulated use of forest
land for various non-forestry uses.
Multi-pronged threat
Both the Congress and Trinamool members have
raised objections to
amendment that provides
exemption for the lands,
“situated within a distance
of 100 km along international borders or Line of
Control or Line of Actual
Control,” for “construction
of strategic linear projects
of national importance and
concerning national
security”.
The Congress MPs noted that this clause could
prove detrimental to significant forests in Himalayan,
trans-Himalayan and
north-eastern regions.
Clearing such forests without proper assessment and
mitigation plan will not only threaten the biodiversity
of vulnerable ecological
and geologically sensitive
areas but also could trigger
extreme weather events,
they said. Mr. Sircar, the
Trinamool MP, recommended that the State governments concerned
should also be consulted
before clearing the forests
in such sensitive areas. He
also recommended that instead of extending the exemption to all lands within
a distance of 100 km along
international borders, it
should be limited to area
along the “Himalayan”
borders.
Members from all the
three parties dissented
against the move to rename the Bill Van [Sanrakshan Evam Samvardhan] Adhiniyam, instead of
the existing Forest (Conservation) Act. Mr. Bordoloi
noted that the new terminology leaves out non-Hindi speaking population,
while DMK’s Girirajan, said
that such “Sanskritic terminology is untenable”.
The DMK members also
said that the amended Act
infringed on the State government’s rights.
